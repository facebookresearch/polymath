Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\",\\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\",\\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\n            \"Mother\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\n            \"Mother\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\",\n            \"Children\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\",\n            \"Children\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\",\n            \"Children\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Height\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\",\n            \"Mother\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Height\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\",\n            \"Mother\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"PhoneModel\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"PhoneModel\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Pet\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Pet\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 3\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Pet\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 4\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 4\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 3\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\n            \"Flower\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\",\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\n            \"Flower\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\",\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\n            \"Drink\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\n            \"Drink\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\n            \"Flower\": \"___\",\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\n            \"Flower\": \"___\",\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"PhoneModel\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"PhoneModel\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"PhoneModel\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Color\": \"___\",\\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\",\\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Color\": \"___\",\\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\",\\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Animal\": \"___\",\n            \"PhoneModel\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Animal\": \"___\",\n            \"PhoneModel\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 4\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Drink\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Drink\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 3\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\\n            \"Children\": \"___\",\\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\",\\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\\n            \"Children\": \"___\",\\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\",\\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Animal\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\",\n            \"Smoothie\": \"___\",\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Animal\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\",\n            \"Smoothie\": \"___\",\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 3\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\n            \"Animal\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\n            \"Animal\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\",\\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\",\\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\",\\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\",\\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 4\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 3\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 4\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\",\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\",\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Color\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Color\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 3\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Color\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 4\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\",\n            \"Drink\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\",\n            \"Drink\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\",\\n            \"Animal\": \"___\",\\n            \"Pet\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\",\\n            \"Animal\": \"___\",\\n            \"Pet\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Drink\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\",\n            \"Mother\": \"___\",\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Drink\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\",\n            \"Mother\": \"___\",\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\",\\n            \"Color\": \"___\",\\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\",\\n            \"Color\": \"___\",\\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Animal\": \"___\",\\n            \"Height\": \"___\",\\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\",\\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Animal\": \"___\",\\n            \"Height\": \"___\",\\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\",\\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\n            \"Mother\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\n            \"Mother\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"PhoneModel\": \"___\",\\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"PhoneModel\": \"___\",\\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 3\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"PhoneModel\": \"___\",\\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\n            \"Height\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\n            \"Height\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Flower\": \"___\",\\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\",\\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\",\\n            \"Smoothie\": \"___\",\\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Flower\": \"___\",\\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\",\\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\",\\n            \"Smoothie\": \"___\",\\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\n            \"Height\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\n            \"Height\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Food\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Food\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 3\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Food\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 4\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Food\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\",\n            \"Animal\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\",\n            \"Animal\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\n            \"Smoothie\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\n            \"Smoothie\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"PhoneModel\": \"___\",\\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\",\\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\",\\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"PhoneModel\": \"___\",\\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\",\\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\",\\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\",\\n            \"Color\": \"___\",\\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\",\\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\",\\n            \"Color\": \"___\",\\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\",\\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\",\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\n            \"Children\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\",\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\n            \"Children\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 3\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\",\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\",\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Height\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Height\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\",\\n            \"Flower\": \"___\",\\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\",\\n            \"Flower\": \"___\",\\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\n            \"Drink\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\n            \"Drink\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\n            \"Drink\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\",\\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\",\\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Flower\": \"___\",\n            \"Mother\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\",\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Flower\": \"___\",\n            \"Mother\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\",\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\",\\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\",\\n            \"Smoothie\": \"___\",\\n            \"Height\": \"___\",\\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\",\\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\",\\n            \"Smoothie\": \"___\",\\n            \"Height\": \"___\",\\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Drink\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Drink\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Drink\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Height\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Height\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\n            \"Mother\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\n            \"Mother\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\",\\n            \"Children\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\",\\n            \"Children\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 3\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\",\\n            \"Children\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\",\\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\",\\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\",\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\",\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\",\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\",\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\",\\n            \"Drink\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\",\\n            \"Drink\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 3\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\",\\n            \"Drink\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Height\": \"___\",\\n            \"Flower\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Height\": \"___\",\\n            \"Flower\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Children\": \"___\",\n            \"Smoothie\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Children\": \"___\",\n            \"Smoothie\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Children\": \"___\",\n            \"Smoothie\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Drink\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Drink\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 3\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Drink\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Height\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Height\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\\n            \"Flower\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\\n            \"Flower\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\",\n            \"Height\": \"___\",\n            \"Smoothie\": \"___\",\n            \"Flower\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\",\n            \"Height\": \"___\",\n            \"Smoothie\": \"___\",\n            \"Flower\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Flower\": \"___\",\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\",\n            \"Children\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Flower\": \"___\",\n            \"MusicGenre\": \"___\",\n            \"Children\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\",\\n            \"Mother\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\",\\n            \"Mother\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 4\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Mother\": \"___\",\\n            \"Food\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Mother\": \"___\",\\n            \"Food\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 3\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Mother\": \"___\",\\n            \"Food\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\n            \"Mother\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\n            \"Pet\": \"___\",\n            \"Mother\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 3\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Children\": \"___\",\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Children\": \"___\",\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Children\": \"___\",\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\",\\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\\n            \"Drink\": \"___\",\\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\\n            \"Children\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\",\\n            \"Food\": \"___\",\\n            \"Drink\": \"___\",\\n            \"Hobby\": \"___\",\\n            \"Children\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Children\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Children\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Children\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\\n\\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\\n\\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\\n\\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\\n```\\nclass House:\\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    houses: list[House, 3]\\n```\\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\\nDo not add an attribute \\'HouseNumber\\' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\\n\\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Mother\": \"___\",\\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\\n            \"Height\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Mother\": \"___\",\\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\\n            \"Height\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\",\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\",\n            \"HouseStyle\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\",\\n            \"Animal\": \"___\",\\n            \"Drink\": \"___\",\\n            \"PhoneModel\": \"___\",\\n            \"Flower\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\",\\n            \"Animal\": \"___\",\\n            \"Drink\": \"___\",\\n            \"PhoneModel\": \"___\",\\n            \"Flower\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\",\n            \"Flower\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\",\n            \"Flower\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\\n\\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\\n```\\n{\\n    \"solution\": {\\n        \"House 1\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\\n            \"Mother\": \"___\",\\n            \"Education\": \"___\"\\n        },\\n        \"House 2\": {\\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\",\\n            \"Mother\": \"___\",\\n            \"Education\": \"___\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\\n')], python_code=None), solver_constraints=None), solver_output=None), solver_exit_code=None), solution=None, num_agent_retries=0, num_logic_py_syntax_errors=0, num_solver_errors=0, num_solver_retries=0, num_solver_timeouts=0)"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"CarModel\": \"___\",\n            \"Cigar\": \"___\",\n            \"Nationality\": \"___\",\n            \"HairColor\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

            "You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:\n\n1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution\n2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution\n\n\nI will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"FavoriteSport\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"BookGenre\": \"___\",\n            \"Birthday\": \"___\",\n            \"Color\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"

We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.\n\nYour solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:\n\n* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `Id: Unique[int]`\n* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `Id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `Name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\".\n* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example that uses these features in combination:\n```\nclass House:\n    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]\n    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]\n\nclass Solution:\n    houses: list[House, 3]\n```\nYou need to always pursue this example, do just two classes one that contains all the attributs ( in this case it is House ) where all the atributs need to be in lowercase and another one that determines the number of data structures that we need ( in this case it is Solution ).\nDo not add an attribute 'HouseNumber' to track the indices, you will be provided in the next prompt an how to manage them.\n\nAlways constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.\n\nIn order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:\n```\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Vacation\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax and make sur to always put the code in ``` ```\n"
