    Abstract base class for adaptive prompt revision strategies.
    A PromptReviser is responsible for improving the constraint prompt
    in response to errors or unsatisfactory solutions, typically in an
    iterative solve loop involving a language model.

    Concrete implementations of this class can define how to revise
    prompts based on model output, execution errors, or mismatched solutions.

        Evaluates the latest model output against the expected solution, and if it fails,
        triggers a prompt revision.

        This method is typically used in iterative solving loops where the LLM output
        must be validated and, if incorrect, corrected via prompt modification.

        Args:
            outcome (str): The output generated by the LLM to validate.
